# minimalist-map
Welcome to the minimalist_map repository! Here, you'll find a visually appealing and minimalist-style map of Córdoba (Argentina), created using R. The map utilizes [OpenStreetMap data](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright) data, accessed through the R package osmdata. The purpose is to showcase various types of streets, roads, and paths within the city.

Code
The R code responsible for generating this map is available [here](https://github.com/marcoscarloseduardo/minimalist-map/blob/main/minimalist_map_code.R).
The code used as a foundation for this project is based on a contribution by Matt Mason, shared on his Twitter account [@mattgmasn](https://twitter.com/geodatascience/status/1728745415632101815).
